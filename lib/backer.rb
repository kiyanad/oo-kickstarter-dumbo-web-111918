# When a Backer instance is initialized, it should be initialized with a @backed_projects variable set to an empty array.
# Instances of the Backer class should have an attr_accessor for backed projects so that projects can be added to a backer's

# When a Project instance is initialized, it should be initialized with a @backers variable set to an empty array. Instances
# of the Project class should have an attr_accessor for backers so that projects can add backers to their list of backers and
# report on the backers who support them.
# When a backer has added a project to its list of backed projects, that project should also add the backer to its list of
